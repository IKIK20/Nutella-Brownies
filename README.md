**Super Chocolatey Nutella Brownie**

Taste: Ultra chocolaty with a hint of Nutella. Read the recipe notes on how to get even more chocolate hazelnut flavor.
Texture: Just wow. Outrageously thick, chewy, fudgy, and slightly gooey.
Ease: Easy but there are a few extra steps involved which really make these brownies the best. Just trust me on the recipe, it’s been carefully tweaked and perfected!
Appearance: Perfect squares of heaven!
Pros: Incredible brownies worthy of any occasion. :sparkling_heart:
Cons: None.
Would I make this again? Absolutely yes. :yum:

 I hope the photos really capture just how rich, fudgy, and gooey these brownies are. Nutella brownies + cold glass of milk = my idea of perfect. What’s yours?
The Nutella flavor is slightly muted with baking. To punch it up, feel free to add a tablespoon of Frangelico to the batter or a cup of toasted chopped hazelnuts if you want a bit of crunch.
